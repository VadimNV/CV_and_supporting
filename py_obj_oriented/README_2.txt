# a small script that combine output from Density Functional Theory
# and a molecular dynamics code ASAP in order to analyze the newly
# implemented 'charge equilibration' model. System - BaTiO3 3x3x3.
# Intention is to create a series of 2D histograms to establish
# connections such as "whenever there is a large transfer of charge 
# on an ion, there is change in such and such property" etc.
