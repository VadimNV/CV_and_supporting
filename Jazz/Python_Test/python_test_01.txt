There are two types of threads in Pythong[1]
 1) Kernel Threads
 2) User-space Threads / user threads

-The operating system executes these threads like parallel "processes". On a single processor machine, this parallelism is achieved by thread scheduling or timeslicing.

-Advantages of Threading:
--Multithreaded programs can run faster on computer systems with multiple CPUs, because theses threads can be executed truly concurrent.
--A program can remain responsive to input. This is true both on single and on multiple CPU
--Threads of a process can share the memory of global variables. If a global variable is changed in one thread, this change is valid for all threads. A thread can have local variables

-There are two modules which support the usage of threads in Python:
--thread
and
--threading

-The module "thread" treats a thread as a function, while the module "threading" is implemented in an object oriented way, i.e. every thread corresponds to an object.
